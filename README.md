## 4301B project by Thomas PERNOT, Terry OLAMPI, Mickael TRAN and Margot UTRERA

This project is a forecasting platform that integrates different time series models, including AR, MA, ARMA, and SARIMAX. The platform is structured using microservices and containerized with Docker. It consists of:

Data Storage Service: A database to store time series data.

Back-end Service: A FastAPI-based API to process and forecast data.

Front-end Service: A dashboard to visualize forecasts.


# Requirements : 

## - Python 3.8+

## - pip (which comes with python)

## - Docker (for containerization)




## Done :

Created the API (working).

Finished data handling (for missing values).

Implemented the models (AR, MA, ARMA, SARIMAX).

Implemented a graphical view of the predictions.

Developped a front-end visualization.



## To do :

Implement the database service. ?
